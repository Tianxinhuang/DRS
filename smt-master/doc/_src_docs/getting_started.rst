Getting started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

SMT setup requires :code:`numpy`, ensure you have it installed.

As some surrogates are written in C++, SMT setup uses :code:`Cython` to compile them.
If :code:`Cython` is not found, SMT setup tries to install it, but as this step is not robust for all
environments it is better to ensure you have it properly installed before hand.
If compilation with :code:`Cython` fails then RBF, IDW, RMTB and RMTC surrogates will not be available.

Note: if you use Anaconda Python distribution, it is best to install 
dependencies: :code:`numpy`, :code:`scipy`, :code:`sklearn`, :code:`Cython` 
with :code:`conda` command then use :code:`pip` command as follows to terminate the SMT installation.

Installing
----------

To install the latest tagged version of SMT: 

:code:`pip install smt`

To install the latest version of SMT from the GitHub repository:

:code:`pip install git+https://github.com/SMTOrg/smt.git`

If you want to contribute to SMT, see :ref:`contributing` section.

Uninstalling
------------

If you want to uninstall SMT:

:code:`pip uninstall smt`
